# Crowdfunding Analysis for Louise

## Louise is an up and coming playwright who wants to start a Crowdfunding campaign to fund her own play, Fever. She has never done a fundraiser through Crowdfunding and is hesistant of where to start. This is where the data analysts' job comes in; to analyze data of past Crowdfunding campaigns to glean from the data which factors of a campaign are often successful and give Louise recommendations of what to consider in her future campaign.

### The purpose of this analysis was to look closely into the relationship of the outcomes (failed, successful, or cancelled) based on the launch dates of the campaigns and then again based on the goals of the campaigns. This deep dive and analysis of the data will provide Louise with relevant information to help her move forward more productively in her own Crowdfunding campaigns based off which past parameters were more and less successful. This project used Excel functions and Excel graphing techniques to organize, comb through, and analyze the data statistically and create visualization of the data in the form of graphs.

### The data was analyzed first by extracting only the parameters being analyzed, in the case the outcome based on launch dates and outcome based on goals. This was performed using Excel functions such as filtering and data extraction formulas.
