# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Extensive analysis and organization of the data set was performed to determine trends in the successful versus failed campaigns. Metrics of the analysis focused on the type of campaign, the location, the launch date, and the goal money versus money pledged for each campaign.

*Analysis of the parent categories found that the most successful campaigns were theatre. This means that theatre had the largest number of campaigns that were successful but theatre was also the most common type of campaign. As can be seen in the chart below, there was also a large number of failed theatre campaigns.

*Analysis of the subcategory outcomes determined that plays are the most successful campaigns. Plays are also the largest of the subcategories and have a significant number of failed outcomes. Rock is the second most successful subcategory and all of the rock campaigns were successful.
